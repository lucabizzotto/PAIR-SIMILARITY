# PAIR-SIMILARITY
## REQUEST:
The request of the project are to implement a sequantial implementation, and then a parallel implementation using Map-Reduce paradigm of all pair similarity of a set of documents.
3 different alternative algorithm in the Map reduce paradigm where implemented.
Then it is required to provide a report discussing the performance of the two different implementation.

#PLOT:
The file anaylis.png show the performance of the different algorithm then on the report.pdf you will find a discussion.
